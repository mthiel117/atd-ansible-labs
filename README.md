# ATD Ansible Labs

Once your VScode interface is ready, we will install the ATD-AVD Repo to your lab instance.  Open a New Terminal console and enter command below.

```bash
# Clone Labs to your ATD Environment
$ cd labfiles
$ git clone https://github.com/mthiel117/atd-ansible-labs.git
```

Then in your VScode, navigate to `labfiles/atd-ansible-labs` to complete lab. All the paths in the next sections will be based from here.

```bash
$ cd atd-ansible-labs
```
